The Scottish Universities Mathematics Olympiad is an annual competition run by St Andrews University Mathematics Society. It aims to promote critical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as serve as a social platform for anyone to meet their soulmates in maths. Since ...., we have had undergraduate students from across Scotland take part in the events. 

All students from all departments are welcome. Although problems may require some experience and knowledge in maths, our problems are designed with minimal background knowledge needed (that means you won't find some 12-dimensional manifold mumble jumbo on the paper).

We also would really love your problem donations, please contact us through email if you would like to donate. Thanks.
