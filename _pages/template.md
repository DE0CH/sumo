# This is a big heading

In order to make a heading, add a pound key and a space and type the heading on the same line

To make the next pagaraph, leave an empty line in between. But if you just want a new line without a new paragraph, you can add `\` at the end of the line \
to make a new line. 

## This is a seconday heading (please use this instead on a page because the level 1 heading is the size of the title)

You can also type an inline equation like \\\( x+y = \frac{12}{7} \\\) in latex, or a display formual like 

\\\[ \sum_{n=1}^{100} n == 505 \\\]

This story of this discovery was legendary.

> In the 1780s a provincial German schoolmaster gave his class the tedious assignment of summing the first 100 integers. The teacher's aim was to keep the kids quiet for half an hour, but one young pupil almost immediately produced an answer: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100 = 5,050. The smart aleck was Carl Friedrich Gauss, who would go on to join the short list of candidates for greatest mathematician ever. Gauss was not a calculating prodigy who added up all those numbers in his head. He had a deeper insight: If you "fold" the series of numbers in the middle and add them in pairs—1 + 100, 2 + 99, 3 + 98, and so on—all the pairs sum to 101. There are 50 such pairs, and so the grand total is simply 50×101. The more general formula, for a list of consecutive numbers from 1 through n, is n(n + 1)/2.
